### Patch Changes

- [#1276](https://github.com/ho-nl/m2-pwa/pull/1276) [`ce09388e0`](https://github.com/ho-nl/m2-pwa/commit/ce09388e0d7ef33aee660612340f6fbae15ceec2) Thanks [@paales](https://github.com/paales)! - We've moved lots of internal packages from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies`. The result of this is that there will be significantly less duplicate packages in the node_modules folders.

* [#1276](https://github.com/ho-nl/m2-pwa/pull/1276) [`52a45bba4`](https://github.com/ho-nl/m2-pwa/commit/52a45bba4dc6dd6df3c81f5023df7d23ed8a534d) Thanks [@paales](https://github.com/paales)! - Upgraded to [NextJS 12.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1)! This is just for compatibility, but we'll be implementing [On-demand Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1#on-demand-incremental-static-regeneration-beta) soon.

  This will greatly reduce the requirement to rebuid stuff and we'll add a management UI on the frontend to be able to revalidate pages manually.
