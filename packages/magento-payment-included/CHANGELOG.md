### Patch Changes

- [#1276](https://github.com/ho-nl/m2-pwa/pull/1276)
  [`ce09388e0`](https://github.com/ho-nl/m2-pwa/commit/ce09388e0d7ef33aee660612340f6fbae15ceec2)
  Thanks [@paales](https://github.com/paales)! - We've moved lots of internal packages from
  `dependencies` to `peerDependencies`. The result of this is that there will be significantly less
  duplicate packages in the node_modules folders.

  [`52a45bba4`](https://github.com/ho-nl/m2-pwa/commit/52a45bba4dc6dd6df3c81f5023df7d23ed8a534d)
  Thanks [@paales](https://github.com/paales)! - Upgraded to
  [NextJS 12.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1)! This is just for compatibility, but we'll be
  implementing
  [On-demand Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1#on-demand-incremental-static-regeneration-beta)
  soon.

  This will greatly reduce the requirement to rebuid stuff and we'll add a management UI on the
  frontend to be able to revalidate pages manually.

* Updated dependencies
