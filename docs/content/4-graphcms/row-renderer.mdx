# Row Renderer

In various places within the project you'll encounter a `RowRenderer` component.
This component is basically a factory, which transforms component data from
GraphCMS to React components.

Configuration is per page and can be done in GraphCMS. See `Content -> Page`,
filter `page/home`, open it. Page Content contains the array of components to
render on this page.
