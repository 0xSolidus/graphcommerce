# Checkout

## Automatically submitting forms causes performance issues

The shipping step of the checkout creates a challenge:

- We need a shipping address before we can show shipping methods.
- We can't save a partial address.
- We don't want overzealous submits to be backend as this creates scalability
  issues

### Strategy: onChange

- Submit the form when a valid form is available by switching the form mode to
  `onChange`.
- We could debounce / throttle this request so it doesn't get submitted too
  often.
- We could check if we are actually allowed to submit by checking
  `formState.isValid`

- Problem: The form still has the potenial to be submitted many times as a
  customer is changing its address for example.
- Problem: A customer might think it has everything selected and doesn't know
  what to do..
  - Since

## Page next button handling

There is a `Next >` button on the page which should always check _all_ forms if
they are valid and submit them if they aren't already submitted with the current
state.

## Query hoisting

All queries should be hoised to the top most page. This allows for query
manipulation on the page level.

- Queries are the domain of the specific project.
- Fragments are the domain of the specific component.

Components _SHOULD NEVER_ include use queries directly, they should always be
passed down by props.
