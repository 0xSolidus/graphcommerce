# Magento 2 configuration

As GraphCommerce is designed to work out-of-the-box with a standard Magento 2
installation as much as possible, very little configuration is required on the
Magento 2 end. As long as your Magento 2 installation's GraphQL endpoint is
available under `https://{{base_url}}/graphql`, almost all standard Magento 2
functionality should just work.

Below is a summary of a few configuration changes that may be required in your
particular setup.

## Correct generation of URLs in transactional e-mails

In order to have transactional e-mails (that are generated from the Magento 2
backend) correctly link to the PWA for functionality such as password reset, the
_Base Link URL_ configuration setting must be set to point to the PWA store URL.

When using different URLs for multiple stores (for example
https://graphcommerce.vercel.app/nl/, https://graphcommerce.vercel.app/be/), be
sure to configure this setting at the store scope level.

The setting can be found under **Stores > Configuration > General > Web > Base URLs**
and **Stores > Configuration > General > Web > Base URLs (Secure)**
