# Libraries and Technologies

GraphCommerce commerce consists of very carefully selected libraries to compose
it's architecture. Maintaining code is hard and therefor selecting third party
libraries that do the heavy lifting is vital.

## Is build with [React](https://reactjs.org/)

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each
state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the
right components when your data changes.

## Is build on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need
for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart
bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

## Is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types. By understanding JavaScript,
TypeScript saves you time catching errors and providing fixes before you run
code.

## Talks to backends with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

A query language for your API. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a
runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a
complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients
the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to
evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## Combines GraphQL+Typescript with [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/)

Generate code from your GraphQL schema and operations with a simple CLI

## Manages state with [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that
enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. Use it to fetch,
cache, and modify application data, all while automatically updating your UI.

## Combines multiple backends with [GraphQL Mesh](https://graphql-mesh.com/)

With GraphQL Mesh, you can use GraphQL query language to fetch from (almost) any
data source, without changing the source or modify it's code.

## Themed with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

React components for faster and easier web development. Build your own design
system, or start with Material Design.

## Animated with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

Framer Motion is an open source, production-ready library that's designed for
all creative developers.

## Data entry with [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.
