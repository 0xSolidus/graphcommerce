# Introduction to Soxbase Commerce

A fully featured next gen commerce platform, with support for Magento 2 and GraphCMS.

## Development goals

- Be fast:
- Be boring: Less magic is more important than absolutely minimal code
- Be beautiful: Deliverying a beautiful user experience makes visitors customers
- Be pleasant: Developing should be straightforward and one mindset to build everything
- Be strict: Code should validate, builds should fail when there are errors

Secondary goals:

- Be PWA: Checking all the lighthouse markers

Non Goals:

- It's better to use an external library and replace it sometime in the future when it becomes
  obsolete then to maintain lesser code yourself indefintely.

## Soxbase commerce architecture
