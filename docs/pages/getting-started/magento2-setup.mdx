# Magento 2 configuration

## Links generated from Magento 2 backend

In order to have things such as transactional e-mails (that are generated from the Magento 2 backend) correctly link to
the PWA for functionality such as password reset, the _Base Link URL_ configuration setting must be set to point to the
PWA store URL.

When using different URLs for multiple stores (for example https://graphcommerce.vercel.app/nl/,
https://graphcommerce.vercel.app/be/), be sure to configure this setting at the store scope level.

The setting can be found under **Stores > Configuration > General > Web > Base URLs** and
**Stores > Configuration > General > Web > Base URLs (Secure)**
