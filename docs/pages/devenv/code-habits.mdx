# Code habits

This sections contains some architectural habits we involve in our working
methodology, as well as general tips & tricks.

General

- Always ask yourself: "Is this something we want to use for every webshop or
  only the current webshop?"
  - If the answer is yes, the component should be split up and data should be
    given via props

GraphQL

- Every GraphQL fragment has a component (Money.gql + Money.tsx)
- Fragments are as tiny as the fragment you write, they prevent you from making
  up new props. Encouraging us to reuse code.
- Queries never have a component
- Preferably fetch as much as you can in a single query, because of caching

Styling

- Material UI is used mainly because of their amount of research, accessability
  features, and theming functionality
- CSS-in-JavaScript (JSS) solution
- Styles are declared mobile first
  - e.g. always use `theme.breakpoints.up` instead of theme.breakpoints.down
- Use `responsiveVal` for margins, paddings, etc

Framer Motion

- `useMotionTemplate` can be used to animate string values. For example, box
  shadows
- `useMediaQuery` is a hook to animate values based on the user's viewport

More information about how to use Framer Motion is found in their
[documentation](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/)

SVG icons

- Delivered with white space
  - small format: 32x32
  - large format: 64x64
- Preferably imported as data-url alongside the component that uses the icon
