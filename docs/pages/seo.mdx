## Sitemap and robots.txt


Sitemaps are automatically generated with every build using
[next-sitemap](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap)

To manually generate a sitemap, use the following command:

`yarn next-sitemap`

As for URLs, the sitemap uses Vercel's `VERCEL_URL` environment variable for
development environments, and eventually falls back on localhost:3000. On
production, use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable to set the correct
url.

Additional sitemap configuration can be done in `next-sitemap.js`. next-sitemap
automatically detects this configuration file.

## Prevent Cumulative Layout Shifts (CLS)

When JavaScript is disabled/loading, elements should not be re-positioned.
[CLS](https://web.dev/cls/) impacts the app feel & Google Lighthouse score
negatively. Layout positioning may not depend on JavaScript as this influences
SEO in a bad way.

Example

- (X) do not use `element.style`, as this manually causes the browser to
  repaint, instead of React's render cycle.

- (âœ“) use conditional classes using `clsx`
