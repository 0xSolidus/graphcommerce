## Prevent Cumulative Layout Shifts (CLS)

When JavaScript is disabled/loading, elements should not be re-positioned.
[CLS](https://web.dev/cls/) impacts the app feel & Google Lighthouse score
negatively. Layout positioning may not depend on JavaScript as this influences
SEO in a bad way.

Example

- (X) do not use `element.style`, as this manually causes the browser to
  repaint, instead of React's render cycle.

- (âœ“) use conditional classes using `clsx`
