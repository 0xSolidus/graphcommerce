# App Shell

`@graphcommerce/framer-next-pages` is responsible for rendering the correct app
shell per page. Its entry is found in `_app.tsx`, where `<App/>` from this
package is used.

This package minimalizes the amount of render calls by reusing the root
component per page. By default, React renders the whole component tree after a
change of state, resulting in a render call for the whole component tree if the
state change occured (nearby) the root.

After every route change, this package checks whether the new app shell
component type is the same as the currently used one If so, the current
component will be reused and will be given new data.

Per page we configure this `SharedComponent` via `PageOptions`, which is set in
the following code:

```jsx
const pageOptions: PageOptions<FullPageShellBaseProps> = {
  SharedComponent: FullPageShell,
}
MyPage.pageOptions = pageOptions
```
